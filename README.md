# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas
As an avid Excel user, I enjoyed learning about how to use pandas to combine .csv data. I thought that the process was very seamless and required a surprisingly low number of lines for the final output (combined files in a new shapefile output). I am going to try and use pandas in my work environment (I work in the accounting department at a large company). I regularly work with Quickbooks and TimeForce reports in Excel to organize and edit the data that is needed for reporting. I never thought of using python or pandas before to clean up the datasets. 

##Carto
This was my first experience using Carto. I thought it was very user friendly and didn’t require a lot of research in order to figure out how to modify the final product. I also liked that the output is user friendly and similar to a common mapping systems like Google Maps for those who are not used to looking at cartography. I wanted my final map to have pop up labels of the type of zone and the number of affordable housing units for the building (“total_affordable_units”) but most of the records were null for this variable. I am not sure if that was an error within the dataset or if that was something that I did wrong. In the affordable housing.csv file that was previewed using “aff.info” it shows that there are 558 non-null values.
